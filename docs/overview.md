# MFA System Overview

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic MFA system that enhances login security.

## Supported Methods
1. **TOTP Authentication** - Generates time-based codes.
2. **SMS Authentication** - Sends codes via simulated SMS.
3. **Email Authentication** - Sends codes via simulated emails.

## How It Works
- The user enters credentials.
- MFA methods are triggered for verification.
- Successful verification grants access.

## Future Enhancements
- Real SMS/Email gateway integration.
- Biometric support (fingerprint, face ID).
